# USA House Price Regression and Classification tasks.

The aim of this repository was to record the data cleanning and processing of the USA Housing Dataset, and later regression and classification task over the curated data.

## Processing Steps

The complete data processing project is located within the *House_price_classif.ipynb* file in this repository, but here it is a summary of the steps I followed:

1.  **Descriptive analysis of data:**

    General description of the dataset, numeric and categorical variables description, correlation matrix...
2. **Missing values cleaning:**

    Different approaches in order to fill the missing values, depending on the nature and context of the variable.
    
3. **Regression Task:**

    Regression task using the curated data to train 2 different models: Decission Tree regressor and Random Forest Regressor. Furthermore, we compare the outcomes
    first using a non-optimized version of the models and then using best parameters found by a Crossed Validation Grid Search.
    
4. **Classification Task:**

    Similar to the Regression task, we train and compare the results of 2 classification models: Decission Tree classifier and Random Forest classifier.
    
## Results

The data has been explored, cleaned and used to train several standard models used in Data Science for regression and classification tasks.
